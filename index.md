### Work 

#### 2023-Current: Applied ML, Stripe
In 2023, I started a new Applied ML team at Stripe to bring LLMs & foundational models to Stripe. We've shipped dozens of applications across the company including support and docs assistants. We've also pre-trained foundation models on 1 trillion+ tokens, and working on many more interesting use cases.

#### 2020-2023: Fraud Intelligence, Stripe

I led the Fraud prevention ML & engineering teams at Stripe. We reduced losses by double digits YoY while improving onboaring experience for Stripe users. We built state-of-the-art ML and backend systems that scaled with Stripe. Here are some of the models & systems including a transformer model on sequences of API calls, unsupervised clustering model that finds novel fraud attacks, and anomaly detection system to detect risky behavior

#### 2018-2020: Applied ML, Lyft
I started the Applied ML team at Lyft. We shipped state-of-the-art applications across the company e.g ride destination recommendations with a [transformer based model](https://eng.lyft.com/how-lyft-predicts-your-destination-with-attention-791146b0a439),  revenue-optimizing mode recommendations, a Thompson Sampling based adaptive experimentation system, optimized tolls prediction pricing model, and coaching program for drivers who drive with their phone in their hands.

#### 2015-2018: Office AI, Microsoft
I led the Smart Reply & Office AI prototyping team. Here are some projects that the team delivered:

* State-of-the-art reccurrent neural net for predicting replies to Skype messages & Outlook emails
  * ~100M parameter model trained on ~1B emails and serving ~10B emails per day!
  * Handled correctness and bias in models
* Prototypes for meeting detection, [task detection](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/02/09/cortana-reminds-important-stuff-even-forget-ask/), and summarization of emails

#### 2010-2014: Bing, Microsoft
I led the Location Personalization & Cortana Ranking team at Microsoft.
