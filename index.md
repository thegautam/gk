### Work 

#### 2023-Current: Applied ML, Stripe
In 2023, I started a new Applied ML team at Stripe to bring LLMs & foundational models to Stripe. We are exploring applications in our Documentation, Support, and even payment network products.

#### 2020-2023: Fraud Intelligence, Stripe

I led the Fraud prevention ML & engineering teams at Stripe. We reduced losses by double digits YoY while improving onboaring experience for Stripe users. We built state-of-the-art ML and backend systems that scaled with Stripe. Here are some of the models & systems the team shipped:
* Transformer model on sequences of API calls to detect fraud patterns
* Unsupervised clustering model that finds novel fraud attacks
* Large scale distributed fraud detection model
* Anomaly detection system to detect risky behavior
* Bringing ML infra to industry standards -- auto-training, feature store, and debugging
* Online streaming system to run ML models and make decisions in realtime

#### 2018-2020: Applied ML, Lyft
I pitched and led the Applied ML team. Here are some projects that the team delivered:
* Ride destination recommendations with a [transformer based model](https://eng.lyft.com/how-lyft-predicts-your-destination-with-attention-791146b0a439)
* Revenue-optimizing mode recommendations model
* Short-term demand & supply forecasting with Conv-LSTM model
* A Thompson Sampling based adaptive experimentation system at Lyft
* Optimized tolls prediction pricing model
* Coaching program for drivers who drive with their phone in their hands
* Optimized ad spend model for driver acquisition
* Prototype for RL based routing algorithm (KDD Cup 2020 3rd place)
* Cancel fee forgiveness model
* Late ride discount coupon model

#### 2015-2018: Office AI, Microsoft
I led the Smart Reply & Office AI prototyping team. Here are some projects that the team delivered:

* State-of-the-art reccurrent neural net for predicting replies to Skype messages & Outlook emails
  * ~100M parameter model trained on ~1B emails and serving ~10B emails per day!
  * Handled correctness and bias in models
* Prototypes for meeting detection, [task detection](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/02/09/cortana-reminds-important-stuff-even-forget-ask/), and summarization of emails

#### 2010-2014: Bing, Microsoft
I led the Location Personalization & Cortana Ranking team at Microsoft.
